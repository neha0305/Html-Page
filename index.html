      <h1>Backtracking</h1>
      <p>Backtracking is a form of recursion.</p>
      <p>
        The usual scenario is that ypu are faced with a number of options, and
        you must choose one of these. After you make your choice you will get a
        new set of option; just what set of options you get depends on what
        choice you made. This procedure is repeated over and over until you
        reach a final state. If you made a good sequence of choices, your final
        state is a goal state; if you didn't, it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceptually, you at the root of a tree; the tree probably has some good
        leaves and some bad it may be that the leaves are all good or all bad.
        You want to get to a good leaf. At each node, beginning with the root,
        you choose one of its children to move to ,and you keep this up until
        you get to a leaf.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you get to a bad leaf. You can backtrack to continue the search
        for a good leaf by revoking your most recent choices,and try another
        choice at that node, if you end up at the root with no options left,
        there are no good leaves to be found.
      </p>

      <p>This needs an example :</p>
      <img src="Image_root@2x.png" alt="root" width="200" height="200" />
      <ol type="1">
        <li>Starting at the Root, your options are A and B . You choose a .</li>
        <li>At A, your options are C and D . You choose C.</li>
        <li>C is bad. Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A, ypu have already tried C, and it failed. Try D.</li>
        <li>D is bad.Go back to A.</li>
        <li>At A,you have no options left to try. Go back to Root.</li>
        <li>At Root, you have already tried A. Try B.</li>
        <li>At B, your options are E and F. Try B.</li>
        <li>E is good . Congratulatios!</li>
      </ol>
      <div class="bg-bck">
        <p>
          In this example we drew a picture of a tree. The tree is an abstract
          model of the possible sequences of choices we could make. there is
          also a data structure call a tree, but usually we donot have a data
          structure to tell us what choices we have.(If we do have an actual
          tree data stucture,backtracking on is is called depth-first tree
          searching.)

      <h3>The backtracking algorithm.</h3>
      <div class="back">
        <pre>
 boolean solve (Node n){
    if n is a leaf node {
      if the leaf is a goal node ,return true
      else return false
    } else { 
      for each child c of n {
        if solve(c) suceeds, return true
      }
      return false 
    } 
  }</pre
        >
      </div>

      <h4>How does this work?</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>If any child of n is solvable, then n is solvable.</li>
        <li>If no child of n is solvable, then n is not solvable.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hence, to decide whether any non-leaf node n is solvable(part of a path
        goal node),all you have to do is test whether any child of n is
        solvable. This is done recursively, on each child of n. In the above
        code, this is done by the lines
      </p>
      <div class="pgg">
        <pre>
        for each child of n{
          if solved(c) succeds,return true
        }
        return false
      </pre
        >
      </div>
      <p>
        Eventually the recursion will "bottom" out of a leaf node. If the leaf
        node is a goal node; it is solvable; if the leaf node is not a goal node
        , it is not solvable. This is our base case. In the above code, this is
        done by the lines
      </p>
      <div class="abc">
        <pre>
        if n is a leaf node{
          if the leaf is goal node,return true
          else return false
        }
        </pre>
      </div>
      <p>
        The backtracking algorithm is simple but important. You should
        understand it throughly. Another way of starting it is as follows:
      </p>
      <h4>To search a tree:</h4>
      <ol type="1">
        <li>
          If the tree consists of a single leaf,test whether it is a goal node.
        </li>
        <li>
          Otherwise, search the subtrees until you find one containing a goal
          node , or until you have searchec them all unsuccessfully.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Non-recursive backtracking, using a stack</h3>
      <p>
        Backtracking is a rather typical recursive algorithm, and any recurcsive
        algorithm can be written as stack algorithm. Infact, that is how your
        recursive algorithms are translated into machine or assembly language.
      </p>
      <div class="ab">
        <pre>
        boolean solve(Node n){
          out node n on the stack;
          while the stack is not empty{
            if the node at the top of the stack is a leaf{
              if it is a goal node, return true
              else pop it off the stack
            }
            else{
              if the node at the top of the stack has untried children
              push the next untried child onto the stack
              else pop the node off the stack
            }
    
            return false
          }
        }
      </pre
        >
      </div>
      <p>
        Starting from the root, the only nodes that can be pushed onto the stack
        are the children of the node currently on the top of the stack ,and
        these are only pushed on one child at a time; hence , the nodes on the
        stack at all the describe a valid path in the tree. Nodes are removed
        from the stack only when it is known that they have no goal nodes among
        their descendents. Therefore, if the root node gets removed(making the
        stack empty), there must have been no goal nodes at all, and nom
        solution to the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the stack algorithm terminates successfully, the nodes on the stack
        from(in reverse order) a path from the root to a goal node.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, when the recursive algorithm finds a goal node,the path
        information is emboided(in reverse order) in the sequence of recursive
        calls. Thus, as the recursion backtracking algorithm, modified slightly
        to print (in reverse order) the nodes along the swuccessful path:
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the recurcsive backtracking algorithm ,modified slightly print
        in
      </p>
      <div class="abc">
        <pre>
      boolean solve(Node n){
        if n is a leaf node{
          if the leaf is a goal node{
          print n
          return true 
        }
        else return false
      } else{
        for each child c of n{
          if solve(c)succeeds{
            print n
            return true
          }
        }
      return false
    }
  }
    </pre
        >
      </div>
      <h3>Keeping backtracking simple</h3>
      <p>
        All of these versions of the backtracking algorithm are pretty simple,
        but when applied to a real problem, they can get pretty cluttered up
        with details. Even determining whether the node is a leaf can be
        complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        for example, if the path represents a series of moves in a chess endgame
        problem, the leaves are the checkmate and statemate solutions
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep the program clean , therefor, tests like this should be buried
        in methods. In a chess game,for example, you could test whether a nodes
        a leaf by writing a
        <b>gameOver method</b>
        (or you could even call it
        <b>isLeaf</b>
        ).This method would encapsulate all the ugly details of figuring out
        whether any possible moves remain.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notices that the backtracking altorithms require us to keep track, for
        each node on the current path , which of its children have been tried
        already (so we do not have to try them again). In the above code we made
        this look simple,by just saying
        <b>for each child c of n.</b>
        In reality, it may be difficult to figure out what the possible children
        are ,and there may be no obvious way to step through them.In chess, for
        example, a node can represent one arrangement of pleces on a chessboard
        and each child of that node can represent the arrangement after some
        piece has made a legal move.How do you find there children, and how do
        you keep track of which ones you've already examined?
      </p>
      <p>
        The most Straight forward way to keep track of which children of the
        node have been tried is as follows: Upon initial entry to the node (that
        is ,when you first get there form above), make a list of all its
        children.As you try each child, take it off the list.when the list is
        empty, there are no remaining untried children, and you can return
        "failure."THis is a simple approach, but it may require quite a lot of
        additionnal work.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an easier way to keep track of which children have been tried
        if you can define an ordering or the children . If there is an ordering,
        and you know which child you just tried, you can determine which child
        to try next.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, you might be able to number the
        <b>children 1 through n,</b>
        and try them in numerical order. then,if you have just tried child k,
        you know that you have already tried children 1 through k-1, and you
        have not yet tried children k+1 through n. Or, if you are trying to
        color a map with just four colors, you can always try
        <b>red first,then yellow,then green,then blue.</b>
        If child yellow fails, you know to try child green next.if you are
        searching a maza, you can try choices in the order left, straight,right
        <b>(or perhaps north,east,south,west).</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        It isn't always easy to find a simple way to order the children of a
        node. In the chess game example, you might number your pieces (or
        perhaps the squares of the board) and try them in numerical order; but
        in addition each piece may also have several moves and these must also
        be ordered
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Example: Tree Search</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        For starters, let's do the simplest possible example of backtracking,
        which is searching an actual tree. We will also use the simplest kind of
        tree, a binary tree. A binary tree is a data structure composed of
        nodes. One node is designated as the root node. Each node can reference
        (point to) zero, one, or two other nodes, which are called its children.
        The children are referred to as the left child and/or the right child.
        All nodes are reachable (by one or more steps) from the root node, and
        there are no cycles. For our purposes, although this is not part of the
        definition of a binary tree, we will say that a node might or might not
        be a goal node, and will contain its name. The first example in this
        paper (which we repeat here) shows a binary tree. Here's a definition of
        the BinaryTree class:
      </p>
      <p>Here's a definition of the Binary Tree class:</p>
      <pre class="abc">
        public class BinaryTree {
        BinaryTree leftChild = null;
        Binary Tree rightChild = null;
        boolean isGoalNode = false;
        String name;
        BinaryTree(String name, BinaryTree left, BinaryTree right, boolean isGoalNode) {
        this.name = name;
        leftChild = left;
        rightChild = right;
        this.isGoalNode = isGoalNode;
        }
        }
      </pre>
      <p>Next we will create a TreeSearch class, and in it we will</p>
      <pre class="abc">
          static BinaryTree make Tree() {
            BinaryTree root, a, b, c, d, e, f;
            c = new BinaryTree("C", null, null, false);
            d = new BinaryTree("D", null, null, false);
            e = new BinaryTree("E", null, null, true);
            f = new BinaryTree("F", null, null, false);
            a = new BinaryTree("A", c, d, false);
            b = new Binary Tree("B", e, f, false);
            root = new BinaryTree("Root", a, b, false); return root;
            }
        </pre
      >
      <p>Here's a main program to create a binary tree and try to solve it:</p>
      <pre class="abc">
          public static void main(String args[]) {
            Binary Tree tree = makeTree();
            System.out.println(solvable(tree));
            }
        </pre
      >
      <p>
        And finally, here's the recursive backtracking routine to "solve" the
        binary tree by finding a goal node.
      </p>
      <pre class="abc">
          static boolean solvable (BinaryTree node) {
            /* 1 */ if (node == null) return false;
            /* 2 */ if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
            /* 3 */ if (solvable (node.leftChild)) return true;
            /* 4 */ if (solvable (node.rightChild)) return true;
            /* 5 */ return false;
            }
        </pre
      >
      <pre>
          Here's what the numbered lines are doing:

          1. If we are given a null node, it's not solvable. This statement is so that we can call this method with the children 
              of a node,without first checking whether those children actually exist.

          2. If the node we are given is a goal node, return success.

          3. See if the left child of node is solvable, and if so, conclude that node is solvable. We will only get to this line 
              if node is non-null and is not a goal node, says to

          4. Do the same thing for the right child.

          5. Since neither child of node is solvable, node itself is not solvable.
               This program runs correctly and produces the unenlightening result true.

          Each time we ask for another node, we have to check if it is null. In the above we put that check as the first thing in solvable. 
          An alternative would be to check first whether each child exists, and recur only if they do. Here's that alternative version:
        </pre
      >

      <pre class="abc">
          static boolean solvable (BinaryTree node) {
            if (node.isGoalNode) return true;
            if (node.leftChild != null && solvable (node.leftChild)) return true;
            if (node.rightChild != null && solvable (node.rightChild)) return true;
            return false;
            }
        </pre
      >
      <p>
        <b>What are the children?</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things that simplifies the above binary tree search is that,
        at each choice point, you can ignore all the previous choices. Previous
        choices don't give you any information about what you should do next; as
        far as you know, both the left and the right child are possible
        solutions. In many problems, however, you may be able to eliminate
        children immediately, without recursion.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider, for example, the problem of four-coloring a map. It is a
        theorem of mathematics that any map on a plane, no matter how convoluted
        the countries are, can be colored with at most four colors, so that no
        two countries that share a border are the same color. To color a map,
        you choose a color for the first country, then a color for the second
        country, and so on, until all countries are colored.
      </p>
      <p>
        To color a map, you choose a color for the first country, then a color
        for the second country, and so on, until all countries are colored.
      </p>
      <pre>
There are two ways to do this:

•Method 1. Try each of the four possible colors, and recur. When you run out of countries, check whether you are at a goal node.

• Method 2. Try only those colors that have not already been used for an adjacent country, and recur. If and when you run out of
  countries, you have successfully colored the map.

Let's apply each of these two methods to the problem of coloring a checkerboard. This should be easily solvable; after all, a
      checkerboard only needs two colors.
 </pre
      >
      <pre>
<b>boolean maplsOK()</b>
Used by method 1 to check (at a leaf node) whether the entire map is colored correctly.

<b>boolean okToColor(int row, int column, int color)
</b>Used by method 2 to check, at every node, whether there is an adjacent node already colored with the given color.

<b>int[] nextRowAndColumn(int row, int column)</b>
Used by both methods to find the next "country" (actually, the row and column of the next square on the checkerboard).

  
  Here's the code for method 1:
  </pre>
      <pre class="abc">
  boolean explore1 (int row, int column, int color) {
    if (row >= NUM_ROWS) return maplSOK(); map[row][column] = color;
    for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor<= BLUE; nextColor++) {
    int[] next = nextRowAnd Column (row, column);
    if (explore1 (next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
    }
    return false;
    }
</pre
      >
      <p>
        And here's the code for method 2:
      </p>
      <pre class="abc">
  boolean explore2(int row, int column, int color) {
    if (row >= NUM_ROWS)return true;
    if (okToColor(row, column, color)) {
    map[row][column] = color;
    for (int nextColor = RED; nextColor <= BLUE; nextColor++) {
    int[] next = nextRowAnd Column (row, column);
    if (explore2(next[0], next[1], nextColor)) return true;
    }
    }
    return false;
</pre
      >
      <p>
        Those appear pretty similar, and you might think they are equally good.
        However, the timing information suggests otherwise:
      </p>
      <center>
      <table border="1">
        <tr>
          <th></th>
          <th>2 by 3 map</th>
          <th>3 by 3 map</th>
          <th>3 by 4 map</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>METHOD 1:</td>
          <td>60 ms</td>
          <td>940 ms</td>
          <td>60530 ms (1 minute)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>METHOD 2:</td>
          <td>0 ms</td>
          <td>0 ms</td>
          <td>0 ms</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
    </center>

      <p>
        The zeros in the above table indicate times too short to measure (less
        than 1 millisecond). Why this huge difference? Either of these methods
        could have exponential growth. Eliminating a node automatically
        eliminates all of its descendents, and this will often prevent
        exponential growth. Conversely, by waiting to check until a leaf node is
        reached, exponential growth is practically guaranteed. If there is any

        <b>Debugging techniques</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Often our first try at a program doesn't work, and we need to debug it.
        Debuggers are helpful, but sometimes we need to fall back on inserting
        print statements. There are some simple tricks to making effective use
        of print statements. These tricks can be applied to any program, but are
        especially useful when you are trying to debug recursive routines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Trick #1: Indent when you print method entries and exits.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, the best debugging technique is to print every method call and
        return (or at least the most important ones). You probably want to
        print, for each method, what parameters it came in with, and what value
        it leaves with. However, if you just print a long list of these, it's
        hard to match up method exits with their corresponding entries.
        Indenting to show the level of nesting can help.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>
          Trick #2: Use specialized print methods for debugging.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't clutter up your actual code more than you must. Also, remember
        that code inserted for debugging purposes can itself contain bugs, or
        (in the worst case) can affect the results, so be very careful with it.
        Here's our debugging code. For this trivial program, there's almost more
        debugging code than actual code, but in larger programs the proportions
        will be better.
      </p>
      <pre class="abc">
          static String indent = "";
static String name(BinaryTree node)
 { 
  if (node == null) return null; else return node.name;
}
static void enter (BinaryTree node) 
{
System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name (node) + ")");
 indent = indent + "| S
}
static boolean yes(BinaryTree node)
 {
indent = indent.substring(3);
System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
return true;
}
static boolean no(BinaryTree node) {
  indent = indent.substring(3);
  System.out.println(indent
  return false;
  +
  "solvable("
  + name(node) + ") returns false");
  }
         </pre
      >
      <p>
        To use this code, we modify solvable as follows:
      </p>
      <pre class="abc">
  static boolean solvable (BinaryTree node) { enter(node);
    if (node == null) return no(node);
    if (node.isGoalNode) return yes(node);
    if (solvable(node.leftChild)) return yes(node);
    if (solvable(node.rightChild)) return yes(node);
    return no(node);
    }
</pre
      >
      <pre>

  And we get these results:
Entering solvable (Root) Entering solvable (A)
|| Entering solvable(C)
||| Entering solvable(null) 
||| solvable(null) returns false
||| Entering solvable(null)
||| solvable(null) returns false
|| solvable(C) returns false
|| Entering solvable(D)
||| Entering solvable(null)
||| solvable(null) returns false
||| Entering solvable(null)
||| solvable(null) returns false
|| solvable(D) returns false
solvable(A) returns false
Entering solvable(B)
Entering solvable(E)
|| solvable (E) returns true
solvable(B) returns true
solvable(Root) returns true
true

        <b>
          Trick #3: Never discard your debugging statements.
        </b>
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing debugging statements is programming, too. Often it's as much
        work to debug the debugging statements as it is to debug the actual
        program. Once your program is working, why throw this code away?
        Obviously, you don't want to print out all this debugging information
        from a program you are ready to submit (or to turn over to your
        manager). You could comment out your debugging calls, but that can be a
        lot of work. What's more, in the above example, you would have to
        replace every return(yes (node)) with return(true), and every return(no
        (node)) with return false. With all these changes, you might introduce
        new bugs into your program.
      </p>
      <pre class="abc">
  static final boolean debugging = false;
static void enter (BinaryTree node) {
if (debugging) {
System.out.println(indent + "Entering solvable(" + name(node) + ")");
 indent = indent + "| S
}
}
static boolean yes(BinaryTree node) {
if (debugging) {
indent = indent.substring(3);
System.out.println(indent + "solvable(" + name(node) + ") returns true");
}
return true;
}
</pre
      >
      <p>
        In industry, actual programs often have multiple flags to control
        different aspects of debugging. Don't worry too much about making your
        code larger; modern compilers will notice that since the variable
        debugging is final, it can never be true, and the controlled code will
        be discarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        <b>Trick #4: Create an Exception.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If an Exception is thrown, you can get information about just where it
        happened by sending it the message printStackTrace(PrintStream). Since
        an Exception is an object like any other, you can create and throw your
        own Exceptions. However, Java programmers don't always realize that you
        can create an Exception without throwing it. For example, the following
        code
      </p>
      <p class="abc">
        new Exception("Checkpoint Charlie").printStackTrace(System.out);
      </p>
      <p>
        will print out a message something like this, and the program will then
        continue normally. That is, the above code just acts like a print
        statement.
      </p>
      <pre class="abc">

            The black marbles can only move to the right, and the white marbles

            either:

        . Jump ahead over exactly one marble of the opposite color, if the space just beyond that marble is clear.
